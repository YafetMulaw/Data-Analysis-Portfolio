# Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis

This project analyzes digital marketing campaign data (likely from Meta/Facebook Ads or similar platforms) to evaluate performance across audiences, age groups, and geographies. The focus is on key metrics such as Reach, Impressions, Frequency, Clicks, CTR (Click-Through Rate), Spend (INR), CPC (Cost Per Click), CPM, and Cost per Result.

Data appears to target student/parent/educator segments (e.g., "SHU_Students(UAE)" campaigns), with heavy emphasis on UAE and youth demographics.

## Key Insights
- **Total Spend**: ~9,543 INR across campaigns.
- **Top Campaigns by Spend**: Campaign 1 (~2,333 INR, high reach), Campaign 2 (~1,579 INR, highest impressions ~67k), Campaign 7 (~1,035 INR).
- **Efficiency Highlights**:
  - Best CTR: Campaign 9 (UAE students 18-24) at ~2.23% — strong for targeted youth ads.
  - Average CTR: ~1.35–2% overall; higher in UAE student segments.
  - Average Frequency: ~1.47 (higher in broader/parent audiences → potential ad fatigue risk).
- **Geography**: UAE dominates spend and performance (high CTR and reach in student 18-24 group), suggesting excellent ROI potential there.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Scale budget toward UAE student campaigns (18-24 age) for better CTR and cost efficiency.
  - Monitor high-frequency campaigns to avoid audience burnout.
  - Discontinue or optimize underperforming segments (e.g., low-CTR broad audiences).
